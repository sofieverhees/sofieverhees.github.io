Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.

still add smt like; I have a broad background....

Welcome to my website!

I am a PhD student in Mathematical Modelling, Analysis and Computation at the Maxwell Institute Graduate School in Edinbrugh. I'm passionate about using mathematical and computational models to improve current medicine. Currently, I am working on a project that models the interaction between chemical and mechanical signalling in cells using reaction-diffusion equations and the equations of linear elasticity.
